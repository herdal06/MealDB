## Tech stack
* ‚úÖ MVVM with Clean Architecture
* ‚úÖ [Kotlin Flow][33] - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* ‚úÖ [LiveData][31] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* ‚úÖ [Coroutines][51] - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* ‚úÖ [Navigation Component][24] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation. asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* ‚úÖ [Safe-Args][25] - For passing data between destinations
* ‚úÖ [Dagger-Hilt][93] - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* ‚úÖ [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* ‚úÖ [Retrofit][90]- Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
* ‚úÖ [OkHttp][23] - Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* ‚úÖ [Room][32] - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* ‚úÖ [Moshi][95] - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
* ‚úÖ [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* ‚úÖ [Data Binding][86] - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* ‚úÖ [Lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
* ‚úÖ [Epoxy][21] - Epoxy is an Android library for building complex screens in a RecyclerView. Models are automatically generated from custom views or databinding layouts via annotation processing. These models are then used in an EpoxyController to declare what items to show in the RecyclerView.
* ‚úÖ [recyclerview-animators][12] - RecyclerView Animators is an Android library that allows developers to easily create RecyclerView with animations.
* ‚úÖ [Glide][27] - for image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* ‚úÖ [Timber][9] - This is a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* ‚úÖ [leakcanary][14] - A memory leak detection library for Android.
